<p>A GTK-based desktop bar-style audio visualizer, designed to run smoother and faster than Impulse (a similar program running on the Screenlets framework) while taking less system resources.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Visibly smoother than impulse and ~half (4% vs 8%) the total cpu usage of impulse</li>
    <li>Parallel design to allow for multiple graphical instances to run at the same time even on the same audio sinks</li>
</ul>

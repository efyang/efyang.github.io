<ul>
    <li>Setup a personal home assistant instance with esphome on an old PC, running as a docker image on a Fedora Linux distribution</li>
    <li>Integrate a personal plex media server over a zfs raid-type array with otherwise unused hard disks, with a small SSD cache, giving fault redundancy and speed (saturates router)</li>

<ul>
    <li>Design, assemble, and program custom PCBs for temperature sensors and lamps that do not have existing smart functionality on the market</li>
    <li>Reverse engineer multiple lamp-type and controller pcbs in order to reprogram them to work with the esphome/home assistant system</li>
    <li>Create a full motorized blind controller with PID position control for optimal speed and to prevent overshooting</li>
</ul>

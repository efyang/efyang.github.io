<ul>
    <li>Take an input image and create contours out of it</li>
    <li>Find a way to connect contours (as they are not necessarily closed) into one closed path</li>
    <li>Apply the DFT and Inverse DFT to find the fourier coefficients of the path</li>
    <li>Use the approximated coefficients to recreate animations of the approximate path being drawn</li>
    <li>Initially prototyped in MATLAB, then moved to python for animation speed (bottleneck was drawing, not calculation)</li>
    <li>Generate text parametric equations of approximated paths</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of planning and soldering was done today. Because the neopixel nano 2427s were not possible to mount directly to the touch sensors by themselves (the DIN pin pointed into the touch button, which would require a wire going underneath the led to connect to it), I've decided to make a strip of the leds separately. For each of the LEDs, a wire was soldered to each of the pins and hot glue was added on top to protect the solder joints, as they really weren't meant to be soldered this way.</p>
